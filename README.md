# Multiple-linear-regression

### Multiple linear regression
Throughout the following exercises, you will learn to use Python to build a multiple linear regression model. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lecture and completing the IVQ for the associated topics.

All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook.

As we move forward, you can find instructions on how to install required libraries as they arise in this notebook. Before we begin with the exercises and analyzing the data, we need to import all libraries and extensions required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using pandas and statsmodels for operations, and seaborn for plotting.
